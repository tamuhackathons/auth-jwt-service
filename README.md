# Simple AUTH Microservice (WIP)
The purpose of this project is to have an easily usable authentication microservice that one could "plug and play" into their existing API or gateway. This project will be 100% working out of the box (currently in development). However, it is also meant to be a starting point for those who want a more customized authentication service. The microservice is also meant to be used how you would like it to be used, meaning certain pages (login, register, password reset) will be provided but are by no means required to be used. If you would like to customize the pages or use another service for the pages, it is encouraged.

NOTE: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

## Currently Planned Features
- Simple login page
- Simple registration page
- Password reset functionality
- Delete account
- Uses MongoDB as datastore 
- Dockerfile and startup script

## Future Plans
- Encrypt everything in database (User collection/table) at rest
- Allow for interchangeable databases with just specifying an environment variable (currently only MongoDB will be supported out of the box)
- Add more security features to prevent against spamming (brute-force) and DOS attacks
- Optional features to have a stateful service that will allow "logout" functionality, even with token expiration
- Verify email

## API 

All optional fields are marked with '(optional)' in front of them. Do not include '(optional)' in actual request.

Also, note that the message is not always `ok`, even if the `error` field is not included

### /register - POST
Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json
- `email`: String (the email associated with the user)
- `password`: String (the password from the user)
- (optional) `firstname`: String
- (optional) `lastname`: String
- (optional) `username`: String (a non-unique username)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String (`ok` if everything went alright)
- `error`: (only included when error occurred)

### /login - POST
Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json
- `email`: String (the email associated with the user)
- `password`: String (the password from the user)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String (`ok` if everything went alright)
- `token`: String (Only included when login is successful)

Example response:
```
{
    "message": "ok",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjVjMWFkNjQ1MjMwNWJjMTJlY2YyNGE0MiIsImlhdCI6MTU0NTI2MjczMywiZXhwIjoxNTQ1NDM1NTMzfQ.RcJv26xteu-SsdiJ572gb4y7GAJ9Jo9dAlUiwvi7oj8"
}
```

### /authenticate - POST - used to verify token
Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json, (Authorization header to be added as option instead of the other two)
- `jwtToken`: String (the token received from /login)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String

### /forgot - POST - used to initiate password reset
Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json
- `email`: String (the user email that is requesting the reset)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String (`ok` if everything went alright)
- `error`: (only included when error occurred)

### /reset/:token - POST - performs the password reset operations
:token is the token that was generated by `/forgot`. The token is already included in the link that is emailed to the user. This is NOT the JWT from `/login`

Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json
- `password`: String (the new user password)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String (`ok` if everything went alright)
- `error`: (only included when error occurred)

### /delete-account - DELETE - deletes user account
Accepts: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json
- `jwtToken`: String (the token received from /login)
- `email`: String (the email of the user that is to be deleted. This email must match that of the user associated with the jwtToken)

Returns: application/json
- `message`: String
- `error`: (only included when error occurred)


## Customization/Configuration

### .env
    # All variables defined here will not overwrite variables currently defined in environment

    # Backend services
    HOST='localhost'
    PORT=3000
    AUTH_PATH='/' # used for the optional pages to direct to correct endpoint location (i.e. '/auth/' or '/auth/jwt/')

    TOKEN_SECRET='secret' # Change this to whatever you would like your token secret to be
    TOKEN_EXPR='2d' # Token Expiration Length. Eg: 60, "2 days", "10h", "7d". A numeric value is interpreted as a seconds count. 
                    # If you use a string be sure you provide the time units (days, hours, etc), otherwise milliseconds unit is used by default ("120" is equal to "120ms").

    EMAIL_USER='username' # the username for the SMTP/email account you are using for password reset
    EMAIL_PASS='password' # password for the account mentioned above

    # Database
    DB_HOST='localhost'
    DB_PORT=27017
    DB_NAME='JWTService'

### config.js
The `config.js` contains some necessary/optional configurations so that you will not have to go digging through the code to fix some things. You might still want to go digging to customize as you see fit.

    const databaseConnectionOptions = {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        reconnectTries: Number.MAX_VALUE,
        reconnectInterval: 500
    }

    function databaseConnectionError (error) {
        if (error) {
            console.log('Failed to first attempt to connect to database:', error)
        }
    }

    // Used to send emails for password reset
    var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net', // change host to your email or SMTP host
        port: 587, // SMTP port
        secure: false, // Change if sending securely
        auth: {
            user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
            pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
        }
    })

    var passwordResetEmail = 'noreply@passwordreset.com' // Your 'from' email for password reset
